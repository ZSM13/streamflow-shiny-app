## Overview:

This an R Shiny App originally developed by Frances Davenport from Stanford Department of Earth, Energy, and Environmental Science to explore historical river flows in the United States.

[Her current version](https://github.com/fdavenport/streamflow-shiny-app) is hosted by shiny and is accesible [here.](https://fdavenport.shinyapps.io/visualizestreamflow/)

I'll be working on some bug fixes and potentially some new features as way to familiarizie myself with R Shiny.
